Serialization: data into form of bytes
Deserialization : reverse of Serialization

Java Beans : Components or functions that is more like encapsulation turning into one object.
Java Beans need constructor with no arguments/ No-arg construtor should be created
Properties of Java Beans:
Getter/Setter

1. getPropertyName() : it is also also called accessor
2. setPropertyName() ; it is also called mutator(play a crucial role in maintaining data encapsulation and integrity by providing controlled access to modify an object's attributes)

Two types of Properties :
1. Simple : N (the name of the property) and T (type)
2. Indexed : consistes of multiple values (e.g. array)


Bound property : can be customised by self

Constraints property : can be customised by other


// Using the BeanInfo Interface
BeanInfo - enables to explicitly contorl what information is available.
Persistant: refers to the ability to store data or objects so that they remain available even after the program or application has terminated


// Benifits of JavaBeans1
- Code reuseability
- Customization
- Clean Code


Transient - uytgsed to indicate that a field in a class should not be serialized during the serialization process.
BDK- Bean Development Kit 

Getter //sets or updates the value of a private attribute in a class
Setter //Provides controlled access to private fields
